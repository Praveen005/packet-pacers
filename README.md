# UDP Network Writer Challenge

## Introduction
This is a hiring challenge for the intern role for core media team at Dyte. The goal of this challenge is to write a UDP network writer that performs significantly better than the baseline implementation.

## Challenge Description
In the `benchs_test.go` file, you will find a benchmark test that measures the performance of the UDP network writer. Your task is to improve the performance of the writer so that it is at least 2 times faster than the baseline implementation.

## Getting Started
To run the benchmark test, use the following command:
```bash
go test -benchmem -bench BenchmarkConnections
```
